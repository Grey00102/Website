        Today I will be using Tailwind as the framework.<br>
        To use it simplay include https://cdn.tailwindcss.com as a src in script<br>
        <img src="firstcode.png" width = 60% height = auto>
        or you can visit the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn">tailwind website from this link</a> to learn more<br>

        To start of I wrote some basic code like this and tested if tailwind was working by using text-red-600<br>
        <img src="first code.PNG" width = 60% height = auto>
        Next I started working on the contents of the page mostly text explaining each step/planning for it<br>
        Then I visited the <a href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs">tailwind documents website</a> to learn and apply styling to my page<br>
        you can also install tailwind css using these simple steps:<br>
        in the treminal Install tailwindcss via npm, and create your tailwind.config.js file.
        <img src="tail1.png" width = 60% height = auto>
        Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.
        <img src="tail2.png" width = 60% height = auto>
        Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your main CSS file.
        <img src="tail3.png" width = 60% height = auto>
        Run the CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and build your CSS.
        <img src="tail4.png" width = 60% height = auto>
        Add your compiled CSS file to the <head> and start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.
        <img src="tail5.png" width = 60% height = auto>
        and started applying styling to my webpage<br>
        The main difficulties encountered were really just choosing the framework and website to host my webpage<br>
        which was solved by github, being an already trusted site by me and <br>
        for picking the framework, I trusted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship"></a>fireship(a youtube channel)</a><br>
        specifically these two videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr15Xzb1Ook"></a>tailwind in 100 seconds </a> and 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZwlzOUOZ4&t=1s"></a>tailwind CSS is the worst.. </a> followed by 
        a little bit more research online.<br>
